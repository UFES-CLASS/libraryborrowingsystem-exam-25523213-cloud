/**
 * Represents a registered library member who can borrow and return items.
 * Inherits from Person — gains id and name.
 *
 * A Member tracks the items they currently have on loan via an internal
 * fixed-size array. The number of items a member may hold at one time
 * is controlled by getBorrowLimit(), which returns 3 by default and can
 * be overridden in a subclass if different rules apply.
 *
 * Inheritance:
 *   Member extends Person
 *   - Inherits : id (used as memberId), name
 *   - Adds     : borrowedItems[], borrowCount
 *   - Overrides: getInfo(), toString()
 *
 * Attributes:
 *   - borrowedItems : fixed-size array of items currently on loan
 *   - borrowCount   : number of items currently borrowed (0 to getBorrowLimit())
 *   - MAX_BORROW    : physical array capacity (5) — larger than the policy limit
 *                     to allow the DB loader to restore state without triggering
 *                     the borrow-limit check
